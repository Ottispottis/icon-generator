<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project was to build responsive a fullstack web app that would allow users to generate modern icons easily using the DALL-E 2 API and could be launched as a SaaS.

The user first logs in with their Google account. Login detailes are then stored in a postgresql database on Supabase. Once the user has logged in they can buy credits using Stripe, which are then used for generating the icons. 

All the generated icons are stored in an AWS s3 bucket and match with the user that generated them so that they can be displayed on the "Collections" page.

This project has a backend for handling the storing and retrieving of user data and icons, processing payments via Stripe and sending requests and receiving responses to and from the DALL-E 2 API. 

It is hosted on AWS Amplify and automatically builds a new version when changes are pushed.
